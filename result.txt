Once , Aunt Petunia , tired of Harry faring back from the barbers seeing as though he hadn ’ t been at all , had contracted a pair of kitchen scissors and cut his whisker so short he was almost bald except for his claps , which she left “ to conceal that horrible scar ” Dudley had laughed himself silly at Harry , who expended a sleepless nox imagining school the next day , where he was already laughed at for his baggy clothes and taped chalks . Next morning , however , he had started up to find his fuzz exactly as it had been before Aunt Petunia had sheared it off . He had been broken a week in his cupboard for this , even though he had sought to explain that he couldn ’ t excuse how it had grown back so quickly . Another time , Aunt Petunia had been hearing to force him into a revolting old perspirer of Dudley ’ s ( brown with orange puff orbs ) . The harder she tried to rip it over his head , the smaller it appeared to become , until finally it might cause fitted a deal puppet , but certainly wouldn ’ t fit Harry . Aunt Petunia had settled it must have reduced in the wash and , to his great reliever , Harry wasn ’ t punished . On the other script , he ’ d gotten into terrible hassle for being found on the cap of the school kitchens . Dudley ’ s crowd had been chasing him as usual when , as much to Harry ’ s surprise as anyone else ’ s , there he was riding on the chimney . The Dursleys had met a very angry letter from Harry ’ s headmistress enjoining them Harry had been climbing school constructions . But all he ’ d tried to do ( as he yelled at Uncle Vernon through the meshed door of his cupboard ) was bind behind the big trash tins outside the kitchen thresholds . Harry supposed that the lead must have hitched him in mid-jump . But today , nothing was failing to go wrong . It was even worth being with Dudley and Piers to be outlay the day somewhere that wasn ’ t school , his cupboard , or Mrs. Figg ’ s cabbage-smelling existing room . While he motored , Uncle Vernon kvetched to Aunt Petunia . He wished to complain about matters : people at study , Harry , the council , Harry , the camber , and Harry were just a few of his favorite subjects . This daybreak , it was motorcycles .

But all he ’ d tried to do ( as he shouted at Uncle Vernon through the locked door of his cupboard ) was jump behind the big trash cans outside the kitchen doors .
